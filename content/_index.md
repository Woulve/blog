## {{< icon "user" >}} About Me

> {{< icon "sparkles" >}} **Technology felt like magic to me as a kid**  
> and that wonder never faded.

I fell in love with technology as a kid because it felt like magic. That feeling never left me, but over time it turned into a drive to understand how things work and how to build my own.

{{< icon "code" >}} **From Hardware to Web**: I started out with embedded systems, writing C for small devices and learning how software meets hardware. These days, I focus on web development, building responsive web applications with Angular, TypeScript, Java, and Python.

{{< icon "book-open" >}} **Continuous Learning**: I enjoy learning, experimenting, and sharing what I discover. This blog is where I write about what I find interesting. From software development and security, to philosophy, privacy, and more.

{{< icon "lock-closed" >}} **Privacy Matters**: I believe in the importance of privacy and data protection. My Computers run Linux, and I prefer open-source software whenever possible. The freedom and fun of technology is more and more restricted by tech giants, and I want to be part of the solution.
